Welcome to my first React application!

# Git Issue Explorer
> Built with React.js/Stylus

## Get Started:
Follow these steps and you too can check out some sweet git issues you could be solving.

Make sure you have node.js >= 6 & npm installed on your machine!

```
git clone https://github.com/Whatthefelix/react-playground.git
cd react-playground
npm install
npm run start
```

If that didn't work, you might be missing some dependencies still, so go ahead and run: 
```
npm install stylus --save-dev
npm install css-loader --save-dev
npm install stylus-loader --save-dev
```
and.... NOW you should be able to run
`npm run start`
